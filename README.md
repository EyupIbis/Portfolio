## Code used

   * HTML
   * CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Animations)

A word of explanation: while I know other technologies as well, like React e.g., this website is solely made with the purpose to present my portfolio and with it, my CSS skills.

## Timing

Started mid-january 2019. No end date.

## Issues

I noticed that on some phones, the height of the container is not adapted to the real viewheight.

## Status

Continuous updates.
